<h3>Ad-Direct 2.0 updated features - Terms and conditions</h3>
<p>Ad-Direct has undergone a complete redo in terms of programming and functionality. To better accommodate the two screens panoramic and other screen configurations, we’ve rebuilt it from the ground up.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the updates that improves the functionality for “you” the end user.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Both screens for the FCL are now linked together when uploading files.   Previous version you had to carefully
          align the tabs now you can simply upload the left screen and once the upload is complete you can post the
        right screen.</li>
    <li>No longer do you need to select video tab or static tab.  The system now recognizes the file format.</li>
    <li>You can also mix and match.  Place a video on the left screen and a static on the right or vice versa.</li>
    <li>You can now set the precise time (Day parting) for the promotions to start and end by simply selecting the
        clock in the calendar dropdown menu.</li>
    <li>All videos now go through a conversion process before being displayed so we can now support Quicktime files
        that will be converted to the “WebM” format.</li>
    <li>Thumbnails are now visible in the video uploads to make it easier to review what is programmed.</li>
    <li>Default ads can now be uploaded by the shopping centre and across both screens so when promotions end there
        is still some mall branding or identification. We often recommend mall hours or gift cards for default ads
        since they don’t change frequently.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Terms and conditions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ad-Direct was developed to give shopping centres easy access to the Neo-Traffic network of digital screens in
               each property.</li>
    <li>It’s a service Neo-Traffic offers free of charge and in return expects that each property respect the conditions of the program.</li>
    <li>It’s meant exclusively for the purpose of mall promotions, Directories, PSAs, charities, holiday greetings, and events but excludes any publicity for mall tenants.</li>
    <li>Since Neo-Traffic’s main source of revenue is limited to brands and retailers inside shopping centres, it negates Neo-Traffics ability to generate revenue if tenants are given free publicity on the digital network.  All ads that promote tenants will be rejected with the exception of charity events that are sponsored by a brand where their logo is permitted so long as it’s not directing consumers to said store.</li>
    <li>For new tenants of the shopping centre, we also offer a free 2 week campaign to bring awareness to the new
        store opening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neo-Traffic will continue to develop new and innovative solutions for the shopping centre and strive to be a valuable partner in improving the shopping experience for all mall patrons.</p>
<p>Kindest regards</p>
<p><strong>The Neo-Traffic Team</strong></p>
